# NuvioTV — Project Rules & Architecture Reference

This file complements the per-user global rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
It documents project-wide conventions and the architecture of the
**Feel** dual-navigation system shipped on 2026-05-18.

---

## Project Overview

- **Build:** `./gradlew :app:assembleFullDebug`
- **Deploy:** `./gradlew :app:installFullDebug` (ADB push to connected TV)
- **ADB connect:** `adb connect <tv-ip>:5555` (IP changes — check device list first)
- **Target device APK variant:** `app-full-armeabi-v7a-debug.apk`
- **Architecture:** Clean — `core/`, `data/`, `domain/`, `ui/`
- **Forks:**
  - `origin` → `git@github.com:dee9law/NuvioTV.git` (your fork)
  - `upstream` → `https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTV.git` (original)

## 🚦 Feel — Dual Navigation System (2026-05-18)

The app ships **two completely separate navigation shells** controlled by
a single per-profile DataStore key (`navigation_feel` in
`LayoutPreferenceDataStore`). Switching feels is live — no restart.

### Feel.MODERN — new default for fresh installs

- SideRail **hidden entirely** (not deleted from code — gated)
- Content area runs **edge-to-edge**
- TopBar carries: **profile avatar (far left)** → **category pills**
  (icon-on-top, text-below; reorderable; per-pill icons-only toggle) →
  **channel pills** (Pill Channels, horizontally scrollable to the right
  screen edge)
- **Profile Overlay** (glassmorphism panel cascading from top-left) is
  the home for Search / Discover / My Stuff / Settings / Pill Channels +
  any demoted category pills (Hidden Items section)
- D-pad Left at content carousel index 0 → opens Profile Overlay
  (reuses the `LocalSideRailController` plumbing — same gate, new
  destination)
- Long-press on Home/Movies/TV Shows → enters **Edit Mode** (Collections
  long-press still opens `CollectionsDropdown`)
- Loop scrolling on the TopBar: avatar ↔ first category ↔ last channel
  ↔ avatar

### Feel.LEGACY — preserved verbatim

- Prime-Video–style SideRail with Profile → Search → Home → My Stuff →
  **Pill Channels (new)** → Settings
- TopBar with side-by-side icon+text category pills + channel pills
- All current focus chains, immersion mode, and Back Level-Up
  hierarchy unchanged
- Loop scrolling: first category ↔ last channel ↔ first category
- No Edit Mode, no Profile Overlay

### Gate point

`MainActivity.TopNavBarScaffold` reads `navigationFeel` via
`LayoutPreferenceDataStore.navigationFeel`, computes `isModernFeel`,
and branches:
- SideRail render: `if (showTopNav && !isModernFeel) { SideRail(...) }`
- `LocalSideRailController` provides `openProfileOverlay` (Modern) or
  `openSideRail` (Legacy)
- ProfileOverlay only mounted when Modern
- Category pill list source: dynamic from `CategoryPillsViewModel`
  (Modern) vs fixed `["Home", "Movies", "TV Shows", "Collections"]`
  (Legacy)

## 📁 New files (2026-05-17 → 2026-05-18)

### domain/model/

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Feel.kt` | `enum class Feel(val storageValue: String) { MODERN, LEGACY }` + `fromStorageValue()` that defaults to `MODERN` for null/unknown. Foundation for the navigation-feel branching. |
| `CategoryPill.kt` | `enum class CategoryPill(storageId, displayLabel) { HOME, MOVIES, TV_SHOWS, COLLECTIONS }` + `PillVisibility { TOPBAR, DRAWER }` + `data class CategoryPillOrderEntry(pill, visibility, iconsOnly)` (the last for G-E icons-only display mode). |

### data/local/

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CategoryPillOrderDataStore.kt` | Per-profile persistence (via `ProfileDataStoreFactory`) of the ordered pill list with per-pill visibility + iconsOnly. Reconciles persisted JSON with current `CategoryPill.entries` so a future build adding a fifth pill doesn't lose user state. |

### ui/components/

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CategoryPillsViewModel.kt` | Source of truth for the Modern TopBar's pill list. Exposes `order` / `topbarPills` / `drawerPills` flows. Methods: `swap`, `moveUp`, `moveDown`, `demote`, `promote`, `setVisible`, `setIconsOnly`. Enforces Home-protected + ≥2-on-TopBar invariants. |
| `ProfileOverlay.kt` | Glassmorphism panel (~280dp, 0.85-alpha black, slide-down + fade-in 250ms FastOutSlowInEasing). Rows: Profile header → Search → Discover → My Stuff → Settings → Pill Channels → (optional) Hidden Items. Vertical wrap with `focusProperties { up/down }` on first/last rows. |
| `AccentFocusHighlight.kt` | Shared focus highlight modifier (`Modifier.accentFocusHighlight`) + `AccentToggleRow` / `AccentActionRow` composables. Toggles now color label with theme accent when ON, dim when OFF. (Pre-Feel session.) |

### ui/screens/settings/

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NavigationFeelContent.kt` | Feel picker — Settings → Appearance → "Feel". Two preview cards (schematic mockups of Modern vs Legacy shells). Writes through `LayoutPreferenceDataStore.setNavigationFeel`. |
| `TopBarSettingsContent.kt` | Top Bar settings — Settings → Appearance → "Top Bar". Per-row: pill name, ↑/↓ reorder buttons, Icon-only display-mode toggle, visibility Switch (Home disabled, ≥2 invariant). Syncs with `CategoryPillsViewModel`. |

## 🎯 Profile Overlay triggers (Modern only)

1. **Profile avatar Select** — `MainActivity` sets `showProfileOverlay = true`
   on the avatar's `onProfileClick` callback.
2. **D-pad Left at content carousel index 0** — the existing
   `LocalSideRailController` mechanism (used by all home/movies/TV
   screens via the `tvLeftFromFirstItemToSideRail` pattern). In
   Modern feel, MainActivity provides `openProfileOverlay` instead of
   `openSideRail` — same call site, new destination.

Dismiss: Back key (overlay's own `BackHandler`), D-pad Right anywhere
inside the panel (`onPreviewKeyEvent` traps it), or tapping the scrim.
On dismiss, focus restores to the TopBar (`navBarFr.requestFocus()`).

---

## ✏️ Edit Mode mechanics

Entry: long-press on **any non-Collections category pill** in Modern
feel. Long-press detection: `KeyEvent.nativeKeyEvent.repeatCount == 1`
(fires once after the system's ~500ms threshold). Collections pill
long-press still opens `CollectionsDropdown` (preserved per the original
spec — CLAUDE.md rule).

State (lives in `MainActivity.TopNavBarScaffold`):
- `var editMode: Boolean` — true when reordering
- Focused pill = grabbed pill (no separate grab state)
- Each pill wrapped in `key(label) { CategoryTabItem(...) }` so the
  same Card instance moves on reorder — **focus + internal state
  follow the pill, not the position**

Key bindings while editMode is true (handled in `CategoryTabItem.onEditKey`):
- **D-pad Left/Right** — swap with adjacent pill; **wraps within
  category group only** (never spills into channel pills). Position 0
  Left wraps to last category; lastIndex Right wraps to 0
- **D-pad Down** — `pillsVm.demote(pill)` (with Home + ≥2 guards)
- **Select / OK** — exit edit mode (drop in place)
- **Back / Escape** — exit edit mode (composed in MainActivity as
  `BackHandler(enabled = editMode)`)

Visual cues:
- Every pill gets a faint accent border (the "moveable" hint)
- Grabbed pill: scale 1.12 + 2dp accent border
- "Done" pill renders after the category zone — Select exits edit mode

Persistence: every swap/demote/promote saves to
`CategoryPillOrderDataStore` immediately (no commit step).

Invariants enforced in `CategoryPillsViewModel`:
- `CategoryPill.HOME` cannot be demoted (silently rejected)
- TopBar pill count cannot drop below 2 (demote rejected if it would)

Promotion: `ProfileOverlay`'s Hidden Items section renders demoted
pills with a `+` icon. Tapping promotes back to the rightmost TopBar
position **and** navigates to that pill's route in one motion.

## 🔄 Loop scrolling scope (Task G-C)

### TopBar — both feels
- **Modern:** avatar (leftmost) ↔ first category ↔ last channel
  (rightmost) → wraps back to avatar
- **Legacy:** first category (leftmost) ↔ last channel (rightmost) →
  wraps back to first category
- Implementation:
  - Avatar / first category pill: `onPreviewKeyEvent` on Left key →
    calls `wrapToLastChannel()` which does
    `listState.scrollToItem(channels.lastIndex) + withFrameNanos + channelFr.requestFocus()`
  - Last channel pill: `onPreviewKeyEvent` on Right key →
    `wrapToLeftmostBarItem()` which focuses the avatar (Modern) or
    first category pill (Legacy)
  - Edit Mode L/R: wraps within the category list (the `onEditSwap`
    callback computes the target index modulo `categories.size`)

### Popups & dropdowns
- **`ProfileOverlay`** — wired via `focusProperties { up / down }` on
  the boundary rows (Profile header = wrapTop, last visible row =
  wrapBottom which is either Pill Channels or the last hidden item)
- **`CollectionsDropdown`** — first/last `DropdownItem` get
  `wrapUpTo` / `wrapDownTo` requesters
- **`FolderPillsDropdown`** — first/last `FolderRow` get
  `wrapUpTo` / `wrapDownTo` (skipping section headers since they're
  not focusable)

### Not yet wired (see Pending Follow-ups)
- Settings hub left rail (`SettingsHubScreen`'s `LazyColumn` of
  category cards — long list, would need scroll-into-view helper)
- Misc confirmation dialogs and any other vertical menu

---

## ⚙️ Top Bar settings (Settings → Appearance → "Top Bar")

Visible for **both feels** (Legacy spec is explicit: shows the four
category pills only). For each pill:
- Name on the left
- ↑/↓ reorder buttons (call `pillsVm.moveUp/Down`)
- **Display mode** single-press toggle: "Icon + text" ↔ "Icon only"
  (writes `iconsOnly` flag on the `CategoryPillOrderEntry`; rendered
  by `CategoryTabItem`'s new `iconsOnly` short-circuit path)
- Visibility **Switch** — Home disabled; remaining pills disabled when
  removing them would drop topbar count below 2

Changes apply immediately. Reorder syncs with Edit Mode (same
`CategoryPillsViewModel` / `CategoryPillOrderDataStore`).

---

## 📺 Pill Channels (renamed from "Networks")

The old `+ Networks` button at the right edge of the TopBar is **gone
in both feels**. Channel pills now scroll free to the right screen edge.
Pill Channels management (the `FolderPillsDropdown` for toggling which
folder pills appear) moves to:

- **Modern feel:** `Pill Channels` row in the Profile Overlay menu
  (icon: `Icons.Default.Tune`). Routes to
  `ProfileOverlayDestination.PILL_CHANNELS` → MainActivity closes the
  overlay and opens the existing `FolderPillsDropdown` popup.
- **Legacy feel:** `Pill Channels` item in the SideRail expanded menu,
  between My Stuff and Settings (new `SideRailItem.PillChannels` enum
  value + `onPillChannelsClick` parameter on `SideRail`).

`FolderPillsDropdown.FolderRow` also gained an inline `AsyncImage` for
the folder's `titleLogoUrl` so picker rows visually match the channel
pills they govern.

---

## 🐛 Collections long-press timing fix

`CollectionsDropdown` now waits **4 frames + 280ms** before
auto-focusing the first item. The previous 4-frame delay was short
enough that the user's D-pad-Center release (from the long-press) would
land on the now-focused item, immediately firing its onClick and
dismissing the dropdown. The 280ms buffer ensures the release happens
before focus shifts.

`CollectionRailViewModel.folderChannels` now passes
`folder.titleLogoUrl` through to each `ChannelTab` so when the user
selects a collection from the dropdown, the resulting TopBar channel
pills show their logos (parity with the default channel rail).

---

## 📅 Pending Follow-ups

These were trimmed for scope on 2026-05-18 and are flagged for a
follow-up pass:

1. **G-D: Smooth 200ms pill swap animation.** Today's swap is logically
   correct (focus follows, state survives) but visually instant. A
   proper slide needs a custom `Modifier.animatePlacement` inside a
   `LookaheadScope` — Compose doesn't ship this for non-Lazy rows.
   Estimated ~30 lines in `TopNavigationBar.kt`.

2. **G-E: Modern Top Bar settings should also list overlay items.**
   Spec calls for Search / Discover / My Stuff / Settings to be
   toggleable TopBar pills in Modern feel. Today the settings screen
   shows the four category pills only. To do this properly:
   - Expand `CategoryPill` enum to 8 values
   - Make `ProfileOverlay`'s static menu data-driven (read from
     `CategoryPillsViewModel.drawerPills`)
   - Update `MainActivity`'s pill → icon + route maps for the 4 new
     pills
   - Default ordering: 4 categories on TopBar, 4 overlay items in
     DRAWER

3. **G-C: Loop scroll on remaining vertical menus.** Wired today on
   `ProfileOverlay` / `CollectionsDropdown` / `FolderPillsDropdown`.
   Still needs:
   - `SettingsHubScreen` left rail (long `LazyColumn` — needs
     scroll-into-view helper like the TopBar uses, since
     `focusProperties` alone won't auto-scroll an offscreen target)
   - Any confirmation dialogs and misc popup menus discovered during
     QA

---

## 🚫 Carry-over rules from global CLAUDE.md

- Compile after every group/step before moving to the next
- Never delete commented-out code marked `// TODO: re-enable for discovery mode later`
- Collections screen (`CollectionsHomeScreen.kt`) is **exempt** from
  layout changes — never touch it
- `LayoutSettingsScreen.kt` (Old Layout) is **dormant** — do not
  reference or delete until explicitly told
- Always create a git commit checkpoint before starting any major
  refactor
- The 3-tier setting resolution (per-row → per-screen → global) is
  authoritative — never bypass it
- Do NOT use `collectAsState()` for layout flows — use
  `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`
- Do NOT fan out subagents when tasks touch `LayoutPreferenceDataStore.kt`,
  `MainActivity.kt`, or `NuvioNavHost.kt` simultaneously
